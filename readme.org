* MaFhammer

An experimental tool written in F# designed to allow users to simulate the effectivness
of model/weapon matchups in the tabletop game Warhammer 40K.

* How do I use this?

Crunchlines for weapons should be stored in the Weapons subdirectory as json files.
The json file is per-weapon. See Weapons/lasgun.json for an example.

* Why F#?

Mostly because I am learning F# as of writing, and it seemed like an interesting fit.
Since we will be doing statistical modeling of data, a (nominally)pure functional programming
language seemed like a good fit.
